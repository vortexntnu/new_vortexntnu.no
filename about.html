                <p>Vortex NTNU is an independent student organization at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. Our team is composed of students from different engineering disciplines from all levels of bachelor and master degree programs.</p>
                <p>Each year we conceive, design, and build an ROV from scratch to compete in the MATE international ROV competition. We dive headfirst into a diversity of challenges in an effort to push our boundaries and improve our communication, organizational, and practical engineering skills.</p>
                <p>We are passionate about science and technology. We provide an ideal opportunity for ambitious students to explore and develop their talents and skills in a collaborative undertaking. Through the project, we demonstrate that we can deliver a complex and integrated product in the demanding environment of an underwater competition.</p>

                <h3>What is an ROV?</h3>
                <p>A <b>R</b>emotely <b>O</b>perated <b>V</b>ehicle (ROV) is an unmanned underwater robot capable of deployment at great depth. The vehicle is tethered to a control unit aboard a vessel on the surface.</p>
                <p>The crew is able to maneuver the vehicle in harsh environments without getting their feet wet. Mounted thrusters allow full navigation forward, backward, sideways; and even rotation around the vehicle's own axis is possible. The mobile device may have video cameras, lights, various types of sensors, sonar capabilities as well as manipulator and cutting arms. In sum; we are dealing with a carefully calculated and sophisticated geometry with appropriate buoyancy, topped with some neat technical gear.</p>
                <p>The possibilities that an ROV offers are countless. Usage includes offshore extractions, construction, broadcasting, exploration and surveillance of the subsea environment - even mine hunting and mine breaking. ROVs can even be used for recreational purposes (just for fun)!

        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <div id="story" class="flex">
            <div id="storytxt">
                <p>Vortex NTNU was founded in 2015, by five students with a desire to gain practical engineering skills through participation in a competition. Since Vortex NTNU became a reality, we have steadily evolved as an organisation. The project quickly generated enthusiasm among students, teachers and faculties at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Soon after, local businesses and industry partnered to lend us their state-of-the-art support.</p>
                <p>Today Vortex is headquartered at the Department of Engineering Cybernetics (ITK), which gives us access to a hub of workshops and R&D labs on campus. NTNU in Trondheim is the leading university for science and technology in Norway with a solid international reputation and as such an ideal base for our activities. In the summer of 2016, Vortex was the first team ever to represent NTNU in the international MATE ROV competition</p>
