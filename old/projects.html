                <h3>2017 MATE ROV COMPETITION CASE</h3>
                <p>The Port of Long Beach is one of the world’s busiest seaports. It is the second-busiest container port in the United States, after the Port of Los Angeles, which it connects to. With all of the activity and vessel traffic, the Port of Long Beach is not immune to accidents and pollution. Thousands of dollars have been spent on the removal and remediation of contaminated sites. Specifically, the port managers are in need of a robot that can:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Assist with the installation of a Hyperloop system to expedite the delivery of goods and streamline commerce</li>
                    <li>Conduct maintenance on the port’s water and light show to guarantee uninterrupted entertainment</li>
                    <li>Identify and collect samples of contaminated sediment then remediate the area to protect the health of people and the environment</li>
                    <li>Identify the contents of containers that fell off of a cargo ship into the harbor and map the accident site to ensure the safety of the port and its operations.</li>

                <p>NASA and Oceaneering Space Systems (OSS) have issued a request for proposals (RFP) for a first-of- its- kind, dual purpose and single launch remotely operated vehicle that can operate in the harsh environments of both the deep ocean and outer space.

                <div class="left-content">
                    <p>The MATE international ROV competition provides an excellent framework for acquiring and utilizing competence from various fields of study. MATE challenges students to build an ROV capable of tackling specific tasks to compete against teams from around the world. The competition is not won entirely by the best performing ROV but rather an overall product in addition to technical reports, poster displays, and financial, sales, and engineering presentations.</p>
                    <p>The MATE competition challenges over 100 teams annually to take the leap of incorporating design and manufacturing, in conjunction with the marketing and sales aspects of engineering. Each team’s performance are evaluated by working professionals who serve as competition judges. The tasks given in the competition shall simulate the challenges that industry faces in the ocean workplace.</p>
                    <p>The competition is held annually at a new location to highlight different problem areas. This year the competition is located at Long Beach, California. Vortex NTNU will participate in the Explorer class - the highest and most demanding level of the MATE competition. Teams are given points based on performance at a series of events, and can earn up to a maximum of 615 points in total. The team with the highest score wins.</p>

                            <h2>Project Maelstrom</h2>
                            <p>The Maelstrom project was the first project for the newly started student organization Vortex NTNU. After nearly 6000 working hours and an estimated cost of 16200 USD Maelstrom was born. Maelstrom is a technical and high functioning ROV, but with a simple square design. Due to lack of experience Maelstroms components are highly excessive compared to its use. The thrusters and connectors can for instance withstand depths of 1000 meters even though the competition depth is at maximum 10 meters.</p>
