    <h1>Sounds interesting?</h1>
    <p>Vortex NTNU is a multidisciplinary project, spanning fields such as public relations, software, web, design, mechatronics and control theory. Chances are whatever competence you have, it's relevant to the project.</p>
    <p>We offer a social, challenging and rewarding environment where qualities such as teamwork, initiative and creativity is valued. Sounds interesting?</p>

    <h2>Positions</h2>
    <p>The following descriptions give an idea of what sort of work we offer. The descriptions are <b>not</b> a list of criterias for applying, they simply outline what sort of responsibilities you may end up having. You may apply for several groups, or you may choose to not specify a group at all, your application is just a teaser for your interview. If you feel that you can contribute with something that is not listed we highly encourage you to send an application anyways, challenging the norm is a core tenet of Vortex' philosophy!</p>
    <h2>Mechanical</h2>
    <iframe class="video" width="100%" height="500px"; src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TinxANRVqgI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>The mechanical group is responsible for the structural components of the ROV. This encompasses the water-tight enclosure for electrical components, the structural frame, the manipulator (robotic arm), and thruster design and placement.Working on the mechanical group will allow you to work on designing and shaping the physical aspects of the ROV.</p>
    <i>keywords: CAD, machining, design, hydrostatics, leadership</i> <br>

    <h2>Control</h2>
    <iframe class="video" width="100%" height="500px"; src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TinxANRVqgI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Control system group creates the software that makes the ROV move. As a new team member you will be working with the powerful ROS framework, which is widely used in robotics industry and research. We develop and maintain the core control system and interface it with hardware, in addition to creating user interfaces and simulation environments. This makes it easy for a pilot to control the ROV, and it makes it easy for the developer to design the next generation of control solutions.</p>
    <i>keywords: ROS, user interface design, regulation</i> <br>

    <h2>Electrical</h2>
    <iframe class="video" width="100%" height="500px"; src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TinxANRVqgI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>The underwater environment places a lot of constraints on the electronic components for the ROV. To this end the electrical group is tasked with designing and implementing the electrical components and wiring that powers the ROVs components and lets it communicate with the surface. As a member of the electrical team will work on a highly constrained system in an extreme environment.</p>

    <h2>Marketing</h2>
    <iframe class="video" width="100%" height="500px"; src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TinxANRVqgI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>Marketing and profiling is important for both Vortex as an organization and for the MATE ROV competition which awards points for having a solid marketing strategy. Members of the marketing group will be responsible for communicating with sponsors, managing the vortex brand and generally control how vortex is seen from the outside. If you join the marketing group you will enjoy freedom in expressing how vortex is seen from the outside.</p>

    <h2>Administration</h2>
    <iframe class="video" width="100%" height="500px"; src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TinxANRVqgI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>The administration group is responsible for keeping track of dates, economy and planning of events. While all groups participate on the administrative parts of vortex, the members of the administrative are ultimately responsible for ensuring that deadlines are upheld and that the administrative aspects of the organization run smoothly.</p>
